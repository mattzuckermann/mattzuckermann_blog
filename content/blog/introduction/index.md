## Hello!

This is the very first post on my first ever blog. I'm so excited to share my projects, thoughts, and findings with you!

I'll be writing a lot more in the future. A New Year's resolution for 2021 is to start a blog and post a new article every week on things I'm either building or learning in my web developer journey, so be on the lookout for more articles on this blog as well as my [Medium](https://medium.com/@mattzuckermann) and [Dev](https://dev.to/mattzuckermann) profiles!

I look forward to learning alongside you and sharing interesting findings along the way. See you later!
